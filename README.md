## Description
TrueToken is an ERC-1155 based NFT platform that helps companies issue NFTs to their customers when they purchase a physical asset. This helps customers validate the authenticity of the asset, as only the original producer can mint tokens. It also helps businesses combat counterfeit products.

- Customers can prove true ownership of the physical asset using the NFT, helping to combat theft as they will not be able to resell them.
- TrueToken receive a unique ID, which they can provide to their customers to validate the NFT. Any NFT issued from the TrueToken contract using their business ID will be unique and authentic.
- The NFT metadata contains unique information about the product, such as the serial number. A counterfeit product can copy the serial number, but it cannot mint the token. 
- The company that minted the token can attach valuable information as history logs to the token, such as warranty activation, warranty claims, part replacement, etc. These are valuable information for a pre-owned asset buyer, as this data is true and immutable.
- Warranty information on the NFT helps companies combat scams on warranty claims.
